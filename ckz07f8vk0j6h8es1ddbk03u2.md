## Introduction: Learning Angular from scratch



Hi! Web warriors...

Welcome to this Angular tutorial series. Here we're covering all the Angular concepts from ground zero. This blog series covers all versions of Angular starting from Angular 2 to the latest editions of it i.e. Angular 13. We will also cover some of the advanced Angular topics.

Using Angular framework, we can take advantage of a powerful TypeScript platform and tools to create applications for web, mobile, and desktop.  With Angular, we have strong tools and design patterns to build either small or large web projects.

## Project Overview

Alongside our learning, we are going to make an awesome project too. The project is about Survey Analysis where we can create a Survey by adding different types of questions, previewing them, and giving the survey link to others to attend it. After that, we can analyze the survey question by question that which option is maximumly answered and so on.

You can check out the project demo too. It is currently hosted on Firebase. Yes, we're gonna learn how to deploy our app too. [Demo](https://survenalysis.web.app/)

Here are some screenshots of the app.
